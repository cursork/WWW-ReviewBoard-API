# TODO

* Tests!!!
* Saving things back
  * Since fetching is lazy - should probably continue to allow setting fields
    before raw is gotten. Getting data shouldn't override our changes!
  * Add trigger / after / somesuch to fields to keep track of the list of
    fields to update against the API.
